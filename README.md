DB Viewer
=============================
This module allows you to execute SQL statements in the admin console. It will display the results dynamically. 
You can also download the results as CSV.  

This is helpful for quick database analysis e.g. "the Client adresses of last month, analysis of your articles etc."

DISCLAIMER: it is possible to execute EVERY SQL Statement. So please be careful. Use only if you know SQL!

Tested with OXID eShop Community Edition version: 4.7
